# Hello-World
This is the first repository created to test and fully understand the functioning of Git

I am a Data Scientist, currently working in a leading Data analytics company.
This is my new Git account and have been working on this trial versions to undersatand the functionality of Git
Using Git, I intent to create, learn and share some my data analytics projects/learnings acorss the network and also learn from some of the existing Git repositories
Git as a platform has made it a lot easier to share learnings over such a wide scale
Looking forward to use this platform wisely
